        "Target Variable: The target variable in this scenario is \"Customer Churn,\" which is a binary variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not. Counting the occurrences of each class (churned or not churned) provides valuable insights into the data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Countplot: The sns.countplot() function from the Seaborn library is suitable for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables. It displays the count of each category on the y-axis, making it an effective choice for showing the frequency or proportion of churned and non-churned customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clear and Concise: The countplot provides a straightforward representation of the number of occurrences for each class. It is easy to interpret and understand the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Palette: The 'deep' palette used in the code snippet provides distinct colors for each category, making it visually appealing and easier to differentiate between the churned and non-churned categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Axes Labels and Title: The x-axis is labeled as \"Customer churn\" to indicate the target variable being represented, and the y-axis represents the count of customers. The title \"Distribution of Customer Churning\" summarizes the purpose of the visualization.\n",
        "\n",

If one class significantly dominates the other, it suggests an imbalanced dataset, which may require special considerations during analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Churned vs. Non-Churned: The countplot clearly displays the number of customers in each category.
